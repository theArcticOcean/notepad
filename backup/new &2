Welcome to CentOS 
The Community ENTerprise Operating System 
CentOS is an Enterprise-class Linux Distribution derived from sources freely provided to the public by Red Hat, Inc. for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. CentOS conforms fully with the upstream vendors redistribution policy and aims to be functionally compatible. (CentOS mainly changes packages to remove upstream vendor branding and artwork.) 
CentOS is developed by a small but growing team of core developers.  In turn the core developers are supported by an active user community including system administrators, network administrators, enterprise users, managers, core Linux contributors and Linux enthusiasts from around the world. 
CentOS has numerous advantages including: an active and growing user community, quickly rebuilt, tested, and QA'ed errata packages, an extensive mirror network, developers who are contactable and responsive, Special Interest Groups (SIGs) to add functionality to the core CentOS distribution, and multiple community support avenues including a wiki, IRC Chat, Email Lists, Forums, Bugs Database, and an FAQ.
